# Welcome to my portfolio page!

Here you can follow the process of creating this website, and also have a guide to it. Welcome!

# The process:

- I work with live server

- I commit regularly in the terminal

1. Started with planning in wire frame. I also collected many pages as an inspiration. Not sure yet, which one I end up using, but will make a list about them.

2. I set up the documents, create css and html files, images folder, and link the sites i will surely use like bootstrap, font awesome.

3. Write my home page - I like to write the text and create sections before I style. I created basic menu with bootstrap and used font awesome icons

4. position the sections with bootstrap
